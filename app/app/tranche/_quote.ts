/**
 * Senthos tranche pricing engine (frontend canonical copy).
 *
 * The tranche product slices a basket of prediction-market positions into
 * three fixed-waterfall claims:
 *
 *   senior    - paid first out of whatever fraction of NAV the basket
 *               actually delivers. Low APY, low tail risk.
 *   mezzanine - paid next. Medium APY, medium tail risk.
 *   junior    - paid last and eats the first loss. High APY, high tail
 *               risk.
 *
 * This module turns a LIVE basket (weighted legs of Polymarket YES/NO
 * contracts with independent per-leg probabilities) into:
 *
 *   1. An outcome distribution for the basket's NAV at resolution.
 *   2. Call-spread fair value per tranche under that distribution,
 *      computed in closed form under a Normal(μ, σ²) approximation
 *      of the basket outcome.
 *   3. A fair-anchored ask price
 *          ask = fair × (1 − target_apy · τ)
 *      where `target_apy` is a tranche-kind yield pickup that scales
 *      linearly with basket σ. The ask is always ≤ fair, so a buyer's
 *      risk-neutral expected annualised return equals the yield pickup.
 *   4. A per-order slippage + protocol-fee quote that also imposes
 *      aggressive per-(tier, kind) capacity caps so tail-risk tranches
 *      are never quoted for size the market can't absorb.
 *
 * The old engine priced via `ask = 1 / (1 + target_apy · τ)` without
 * referencing fair value at all — producing e.g. a $0.94 ask on a LOW
 * junior whose fair value was $0.004, and advertising +75% APY on a
 * position with ~99.6% expected loss. The fair-anchored formula here
 * is mathematically sound across all 9 (tier, window) cells.
 *
 * Everything below is derived from the LiveBasket + LiveMarket data
 * surfaced by /app/_lib/live-baskets.ts — there are NO hard-coded per-
 * basket constants. The only constants are model hyperparameters
 * (capital cost of underwriting, tranche-kind multipliers, etc.) which
 * are all labelled inline.

 *                       ≤  Σ width_k · fair_k
 *                       =  μ
 * i.e. it is ALWAYS ≤ the expected basket payout. The protocol's
 * real-world structural profit is therefore expected to come from
 *   (a) Polymarket bid-ask capture on basket construction (legs
 *       bought at bid < the `probability` mids used here as fair), and
 *   (b) per-order `PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS` collected on deposits/redemptions.
 * Neither is modelled inside this pricing engine — the engine only
 * produces user-facing quotes that are honest about risk-adjusted
 * expected return. A future revision can toggle a senior markup here

  // to convert an MM-side exposure into a USDC-side clip. That math
  // assumes a tranche is a linear claim on basket NAV; for convex
  // slices it grossly over-allocates junior/mezz (e.g. $5M+ of
  // permissible USDC input on a $50k hedge book because each user
  // dollar looks like only 3% of hedge pressure — ignoring that it
  // also creates 18× face leverage).
  //
  // New model: the desk can warehouse at most `FACE_BUDGET[kind] ×
  // hedgeCapacity` of face obligation across this tranche. Since
  // each user dollar buys `1 / marketPrice` tokens of face, that
  // face budget translates to a user USDC cap of:
  //
  //   maxUsdc = hedgeCapacity × FACE_BUDGET[kind] × marketPrice

  // retains a multi-hundred-k cap, matching its near-linear hedge.
