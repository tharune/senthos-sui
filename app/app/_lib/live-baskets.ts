/**
 * Live-basket synthesis.
 *
 * The /app/basket page shows "synthetic" baskets — groupings of real, live
 * Polymarket markets bucketed by:
 *   - probability tier         (90 = 85-99%, 70 = 25-75%, 50 = 1-12%)
 *   - resolution window        (week = <7d, month = 30-90d, long = 180d+)
 *
 * Each underlying Polymarket market contributes TWO candidate legs — its YES
 * side and its NO side — and the bucket each side lands in depends on its
 * own probability. That means a low-probability market can still power a
 * high-tier basket by taking its NO side, which widens the pool of eligible
 * legs without having to lower liquidity or tier thresholds.
 *
 * Correlation dedupe runs on three axes so no two legs track the same bet:
 *   1. underlying market id — a given market contributes at most one leg
 *      across all nine baskets (prevents YES in 50-tier + NO in 90-tier).
 *   2. Polymarket `event_id` — every market in one event (e.g. "What will
 *      happen before GTA VI?") shares a resolution frame and is therefore
 *      correlated; only one market per event wins a basket slot across the
 *      whole grid.
 *   3. question-topic fingerprint — a coarse token-set hash so near-duplicate
 *      questions without a shared event (rare, but happens) are still
 *      treated as correlated.
 *
 * We build baskets client-side from the backend's /api/markets feed so the
 * UI always reflects the current state of Polymarket, without needing a
 * persisted basket table per (tier,window) combo on the backend.

/**
 * Build the 3×3 grid of baskets from a pool of sided candidates.
 *
 * Basket filling is *comprehensive*: each (tier, window) combo collects
 * every candidate that passes the liquidity + correlation filters. There
 * is no upper cap on basket size — the more uncorrelated, liquid legs a
 * (tier, window) can field, the bigger the basket. MIN_BASKET_LEGS acts as
 * a floor: below it we surface a placeholder card instead.
 *
 * Correlation dedupe has two scopes:
 *   Global (across all nine baskets): only `underlyingId`. This prevents
 *     the YES of a market landing in one tranche while its NO lands in
 *     another — those two sides exactly offset. Event / topic collisions
 *     are allowed across baskets because different tranches represent
 *     different risk profiles; one GTA-VI market can sit in the 90-week
 *     basket while another from the same event sits in the 70-long.
 *   Per-basket: `underlyingId`, `eventId`, and `topicKey` are all strict.
 *     Within a single basket no two legs may share an underlying market,
 *     event, or near-duplicate question — so the basket itself never
 *     contains correlated legs.
 *
 * Per-basket diversity:
 *   • category ceil  — first pass holds each category to
 *                      CATEGORY_SHARE_CEIL of the running basket size so a
 *                      hot topic (election week, NFL playoffs) can't
 *                      dominate. Second pass ignores the ceil to top up
 *                      toward MIN_BASKET_LEGS when the strict pass was too
 *                      restrictive.
 *
 * Weighting:
 *   • After the roster is locked, weights come from an index-fund style
 *     sqrt(volume) model with per-leg min/max clamps that scale with basket
 *     size (see `computeLegWeights`). NAV and 24h change are weighted sums
 *     over the legs. `issue` tracks the live NAV so the "issue price" tile
 *     on the detail page is never stale.
 *   • Tiers listed in `TIER_TARGET_NAV` get a second pass: weights are
 *     tilted exponentially (still under the per-leg caps) so the weighted
 *     probability lands near the tier's target NAV, plus a seeded
 *     ±TIER_TARGET_JITTER offset per basket. All three tiers are pinned:
 *     HIGH→~95%, MID→~50%, LOW→~5%.
 *
 * Combo processing order matters: higher-tier baskets go first because
 * they're typically the sparsest pool of candidates. If we let the 70 tier
 * claim first pick, the extreme tiers would starve.
